      			<p>Medical Education</p>
<br>
<p>Let “<span class="theme2">Orbital career</span>” explain the importance of medical education. Medical education is the bedrock on which high-quality healthcare is built. Training is important but education is vital. Of course, the newly graduated doctor needs extensive knowledge and practical skills and that is where training is important. But education during these formative years will establish the principles that will guide doctors through their ever-changing careers. Medical students must be educated in an atmosphere where excellence is expected; and excellence means that students must be curious about new ideas, want to know more and do things better. Medical students must be encouraged to be stimulated by the unknown, not intimidated by it; to work with uncertainty, not run away from it; to question the status quo, not accept it as always right; to analyse, to weigh evidence and to challenge. It is this education which will enable doctors to lead change as the years go by.  “<span class="theme2">Orbital career</span>” helps in selecting suitable course and college as per your requirement.</p><br>
